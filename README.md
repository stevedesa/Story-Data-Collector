 * The purpose of this program is the get the use familiar with singly linked
   lists. This program will count how often a word appears in a document.
   To do this, our team will design a class that utilizes linked lists to store
   a word and count how often the word is found within the document. A word may
   only be inserted into this list once and if it is found more than once, then
   a frequency counter will be incremented for that word. 
  
 * After inserting the words from the document, there will be a specific output
   required based on the user input. Any functions related to the the class 
   list will be stored in the public section. Only the data will be stored
   in the private section. Any other functions written will be outside of the
   class list.
  
 * For start up, there will be 4 or 5 command line arguments provided.
   The first being the program executable itself. The second will be the
   document file to read the words from. The third will be the data file were
   a list of words based on the first character will be outputted to. The 
   fourth will be a file where frequency of words and lenght of words will be 
   outputted to. The fifth argument is optional. If specified, it will output
   based on the order of the string. If not specified, the program will output
   the frequency of the words be default. -f will be for the frequency and -l
   will be for the length. -lf will output the length and then the frequency.
   -fl will output the frequency and then the length. If there is anything that
   isnt allowed or a file that isn't a valid option, then the usage statment
   provided a correct example will be outputted to the console screen.
